# #OpenSource clients

## This repository contains sources from different Minecraft clients whose source code has leaked or been deobfuscated

### Many of the clients on this list can't be run that easily because they are made for code review only
### Also I haven't checked the code of each client so I can't claim that they don't contain viruses
